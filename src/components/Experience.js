                  this winter in Vancouver and got to meet some amazing people.
                  I was on the Flight and Safety Data Analytics team, building
                  algorithms for the backend of a flight data analytics tool and
                  an internal client-facing web application. I learned a lot
                  about aviation, aerospace and defence.
