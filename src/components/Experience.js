                  this winter in Vancouver and got to meet some amazing people.
                  I was on the Flight and Safety Data Analytics team, working
                  with the backend and an internal client-facing web
                  application. I learned a lot about the aviation and aerospace
                  industry.

                      Assisted with the development of a predictive maintenance
                      alerting system for airlines reducing unscheduled
                      maintenance events and minimizing downtime by 33%.

                    <li>
                      Created cloud functions for a data pipeline that keep an
                      eye on specific data levels that can be customized by
                      users. When these levels reach a certain point, they send
                      out alerts.

                    <li>
                      Decreased data analysis runtime by 45% by refining and
                      implementing algorithms that process 1+ million raw flight
