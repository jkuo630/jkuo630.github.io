                  this winter in Vancouver and got to meet some amazing people.
                  I was on the Flight and Safety Data Analytics team, building
                  algorithms for the backend of a flight data analytics tool and
                  an internal client-facing web application. I learned a lot
                  about the aviation, aerospace and defence industry.

                      Assisted with the development of a full-stack predictive
                      maintenance alerting system with data visualization using
                      React and Python for airlines reducing unscheduled
                      maintenance events and minimizing downtime.

                    <li>
                      Created cloud functions for a data pipeline that keep an
                      eye on specific data levels that can be customized by
                      users. When these levels reach a certain point, they send
                      out alerts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Decreased data analysis runtime by 25% by refining and
                      implementing algorithms that process 2+ million raw flight
                      data points.
